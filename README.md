# Pitch-Perfect
I built this app with the help of an online course on Udacity, [Intro to iOS App Development with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585).
The app has two screens, one in which the user can record his or her voice. The app then moves onto the next screen where the user
can play back the recorded voice with sound effects like Snail (slow pace), Rabbit (fast pace), Chipmunk (high pitch), Darth Vader (low pitch), 
Echo and Reverb.
